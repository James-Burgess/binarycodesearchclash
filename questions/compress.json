	"description": "In this exercise, you're going to decompress a compressed string.\n\nYour input is a compressed string of the format number[string] and the decompressed output form should be the string written number times. For example:\n\nThe input\n\n3[abc]4[ab]c\n\nWould be output as\n\nabcabcabcababababc\n\nOther rules\nNumber can have more than one digit. For example, 10[a] is allowed, and just means aaaaaaaaaa\n\nOne repetition can occur inside another. For example, 2[3[a]b] decompresses into aaabaaab\n\nCharacters allowed as input include digits, small English letters and brackets [ ].\n\nDigits are only to represent amount of repetitions.\n\nLetters are just letters.\n\nBrackets are only part of syntax of writing repeated substring.\n\nInput is always valid, so no need to check its validity.\"",
